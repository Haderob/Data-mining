## Bank Term Deposit Prediction Project
This repository contains the source code and trained model for predicting the success of telemarketing campaigns in selling bank term deposits.

Project Overview:

This is a data mining project that utilizes machine learning techniques to predict client subscriptions for bank term deposits based on customer information. Two models are explored:

Support Vector Machine (SVM): Trained with a linear kernel for classification.
Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees for improved prediction accuracy.
Data:

The project utilizes the publicly available "bank.csv" dataset, which can be found at (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wfCLMlWif_vrBvBWKC-PvigOVY6jwmFm/view?usp=drive_link).

Code:

The source code is written in [insert programming language, e.g., Python] and includes:

Data preprocessing: Scripts for cleaning, preparing, and encoding the data.
Model training: Scripts for training both SVM and Random Forest models.
Evaluation: Scripts for evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.
Trained Model:

The project includes the trained Random Forest model saved in a format suitable for making predictions on new data (e.g., pickle file for Python). This model achieved a test accuracy of 89.6%, compared to SVM's 86.53%.

Requirements:

To run the code, you will need the following:

Python
Instructions:

Clone this repository.
Run the desired scripts (e.g., for training or prediction).
Note:

This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used for real-world financial decisions.

Further Exploration:

Explore the use of other machine learning algorithms for comparison.
Investigate the impact of hyperparameter tuning on model performance.
Incorporate additional features related to customer demographics or product information for potentially enhanced predictions.
